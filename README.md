This program is made for my personal learning purposes and is unsafe to use for any real project.

## Objective
This program has multiple iterations of me trying to solve a real-life problem of comparing SPs from multiple Databases (MS-SQL).

## Conclusion
I was successfully able to build a program that compares SPs from multiple databases and generate a usefule excel report.
I was also able to generate html diff files to showcase the differences.
